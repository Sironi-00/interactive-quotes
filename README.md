# interactive-quotes 
_Shows a random quote with missing words and the user has to select the correct word order. [Authour](https://github.com/Sironi-00)_

## Features
* Get a random quoute which has missing words that are rendered as `buttons` and the user clicks the words to fill the qoute.
* When all fill words are entered the user will get a **feedback** (results).

### Functions
```
- [x] Reload -> Generates a random quote.
- [x] Reveal -> Shows a complete quote.
- [x] Clear -> reset all changes on the quote
```

#### Modifying
```
You can clone and modify the project in anyway you prefer.
```

#### Upgrade
Changing the **static quotes list** to an external *(API)* could make the app greatly better as it would have more diverse quotes to pull from.
